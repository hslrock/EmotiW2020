## ABSTRACT

Our paper presents a multimodal self-attention network for the
Emotion Recognition in the Wild (EmotiW 2020) Grand Challenge
in group-video level emotion recognition. We tackle this challenging problem within a multimodal architecture employing several
subnetworks. Critically, we employ a self-attention network that
models relationships between faces within and across the multiframe sequences. This helps the model to learn which face and
which frame is important for emotion decoding. Our results show
that the proposed architecture achieves 55.2% and 52.5% accuracy
on the validation and testing sets of the challenge. Although not
among the top entries in terms of performance, we demonstrate
the efficacy of our model by analyzing the self-attention network
in more detail.
